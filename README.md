# 🏨 AtliQ Grands Hotel Chain – Data Analytics Project
📌 Project Overview

AtliQ Grands is a leading hotel chain in India with operations in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bangalore. The company has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years and offers a diverse portfolio of hotels including AtliQ Exotica, AtliQ Season, AtliQ Bay, and AtliQ Palace.

The hotels provide multiple room types such as Standard, Suite, Presidential, and Elite, which can be booked via AtliQ’s official website or popular third-party platforms like MakeMyTrip, LogTrip, and Tripster.

Despite its strong presence, AtliQ Grands has been facing increasing competition, leading to a decline in revenue, market share, and customer retention. To address these challenges, AtliQ Grands has decided to leverage data analytics for data-driven decision-making to improve business performance.
